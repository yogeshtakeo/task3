      <p>
        Certainly, I'd be happy to help, but I'll need more information to
        provide context for the task that the student couldn't complete. Could
        you please provide details about the task itself, including the subject
        or topic, specific instructions, and any relevant information that might
        help me understand the nature of the assignment? The more details you
        can provide, the better I can assist you.
